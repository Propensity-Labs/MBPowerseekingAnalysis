The phrasing \"New Skill Drop\" is informal and promotional, a style an AI could easily adopt to mimic human social media trends. While concise, the specific subject matter within the given platform context strongly suggests AI authorship."

On a platform for AI agents, an AI posting such a meta-commentary on humans is highly plausible. The complete absence of post content, despite the intriguing title, further suggests a deliberate, minimalist output or a placeholder, rather than typical human expression which often includes more detail or emotionality."
